• User should be able to:
    • Unlike liked posts
    • Dislike posts
    
• Improve efficiency of displying users who like a post

• Paginate notifications in index views
• Display when someone commented on our post (use time_ago_in_words helper method)
• Display read and unread notifications (count must also be changed; similar to add/remove comments)
• Divide index page into read/unread
• Add notifications for likes (logic is similar to comment notifications; like action in posts controller...; 
  differences with 'notice_type' and 'identifier' parameters of the new Notification)
